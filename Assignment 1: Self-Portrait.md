## Assignment 1: Self-Portrait

  Coding my self-portrait was an enjoyable experience. It took me a bit of time to create this portrait. A challenge I faced while making this code was every time I wanted to delete a stroke or thicken a stroke, all the strokes on the drawing would change. Therefore, I had to keep playing around with it until I got it the way I wanted it to look. Another obstacle that occurred in the process of creating my portrait was moving the shapes and trying to get them in the position I wanted them to be. For that reason, it was difficult to have many details in the face.
