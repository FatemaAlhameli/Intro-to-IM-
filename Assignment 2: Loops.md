## Assignment 2: Loops

[Simple art using loops](https://editor.p5js.org/FatemaAlhameli/sketches/i_dG9Pp3W)

When I started this assignment I first kept creating for loops with ellipses and rectangles. However, I felt the drawing still looked boring. So I started over and began to explore creating lines with for loops. I kept playing around with the line loop until I got this combination of horizontal and vertical lines dragged, which looked pretty interesting. I then attempted and succeeded to do the same on the top right corner. To add more lines I created separated diagonal lines from the bottom left corner up to the middle. Then I did the same thing for the top right corner, which led them all to connect. Lastly, I added a diagonal row of ellipses from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. 

To play around more with the drawing I added a random stroke weight, which gave the lines a more appealing look. I also tried to create random sizes for the ellipses, however, it was disturbing to the eye so I kept them all at the same size. A challenge I faced while creating this drawing was that every time I tried to fill the lines with color it did not work. I didnâ€™t understand why this happened because it was working the past week. Overall, I feel more confident with using for loops, as at the beginning of the week I struggled a bit with understanding them. For my next steps, I would like to incorporate animation with loops and create more things with them.
