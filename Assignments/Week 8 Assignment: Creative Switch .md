### Zip the back to turn on the LED!
For this assignment I created a switch to turn on a yellow LED light. By the use of a bag zipper that has two parts of a butterfly attached to it, the switch is able to work. The wires are taped to the back of the butterfly parts and then taped on each zipper’s pull tab. The wire needles are placed horizontally behind the butterfly parts so that when both zippers meet, the LED will turn on. Ultimately when the zippers are unzipped and separated, the light turns off, and it turns on once they are zipped back together. 

## Creation Process:
Following the same class instructions on how to use input and output in Arduino and the process of using it to turn a LED light, I managed to create my switch. Firstly I placed the resistor on the breadboard on the h column from 3 - 7. Using a red wire, I placed first on the positive column and placed the other side of the wire on the 5V on the Arduino board. Similarly, I used a black wire that I plugged in the second negative column on the breadboard and the other side of it on the GND in the Arduino board. I then took a red wire that I placed under the first red wire on the positive column, and the other side of the wire, I placed it on the h column second line. Next, I put a yellow LED on the f column with the positive side of it going first. Using another black wire, I placed it on the negative column on line 15 and placed the other side of the wire on column h on line 15. Lastly, to create the switch wires, I used two green wires. I plugged both on the h column, one on the seventh line and the other on the 15th. Ultimately while the USB cable is attached to my laptop and the Arduino board, when both green wires touch, the LED light would turn on. I then attached the green wires to each butterfly part so that when they are connected, the LED turns on. 

At first, I wasn’t sure how I would create such a switch. I had the idea of using zippers and attaching the switch wires to them. Although it's a unique idea, I felt it still needed to be more creative. Therefore, I decided to create a figure out of aluminum foil. In this part, I struggled with coming out with a fun yet simple design that could be created with foil. A butterfly was the design I proceeded with. I used a marker to draw the outline of the butterfly on foil and then cut it out. After, I cut the butterfly from the middle in order to attach each side separately. Using tape, I attached the wires horizontally on the back of the butterfly sides. The reason I taped them horizontally is that I first had them vertically but when I placed the foil butterfly parts next to each other the light did not turn on. Later on, I taped the whole wire to each zipper. 

## Challenges:
Throughout this assignment, I faced multiple challenges. The process of using the Arduino and wires to make the LED light work was pretty successful. However, when trying to create the switch, I came across some obstacles. The main challenge I had trouble with was trying to make the LED work by using aluminum foil. After attaching the wires to the butterfly sides vertically, I turned on the Arduino and made sure the foil parts were overlapping. However, the light appeared not to be working. I was surprised as to why it was not working. I figured I would use other materials such as copper or metal wires, but I didn’t have anything available. To solve this problem, I decided to place the wires horizontally on the back of the butterfly sides. This ultimately allowed the metal tips of the wires to touch when the zipper was closed. Thus, the LED switch worked. Another challenge was that when I zipped the back I still needed to adjust the butterfly in order for the light to turn on. This leads me to a minor issue I had which was that it was difficult to stable both the butterfly and wire on the zippers pull tab. Therefore, this meant that sometimes I needed to adjust the butterfly in order to ensure that the light would work. 

I had also considered other switch ideas when I came up with the butterfly figure. I was thinking of attaching each foil part with the wires to my thumb and middle finger so that when I snap my fingers the LED would turn on. However, this idea seemed like it would be unstable and inconsistent with turning on the light. Therefore, the zipper was a much more suitable option.

## Next Steps: 
* Improve stability of the structure
* Improve consistency of the LED
